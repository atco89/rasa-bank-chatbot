      This flow handles credit card purchases by collecting the card type and delivery method. 
      If "Home" is selected, a delivery address is gathered; otherwise, a branch is chosen. 
      Finally, the order recap is reviewed and confirmed, leading to either a confirmation message or further assistance.
